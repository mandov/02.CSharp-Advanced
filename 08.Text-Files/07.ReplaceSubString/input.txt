Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to start?
I think it's time for me to start taking my responsibilities seriously. As soon as I can get a decent video camera, I'll start making videos to put online.
I started a new blog. I'll do my best not to be one of those people who blogs a lot right at the start and then quits blogging.
