Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to finish?
I think it's time for me to finish taking my responsibilities seriously. As soon as I can get a decent video camera, I'll finish making videos to put online.
I finished a new blog. I'll do my best not to be one of those people who blogs a lot right at the finish and then quits blogging.
